A positive integer N is given. The goal is to construct the shortest possible sequence of integers ending with N, using the following rules:
- the first element of the sequence is 1; more specifically: A[0] = 1,
- each of the following elements is generated by multiplying the previous element by 2 or increasing it by 1; more precisely: A = A[i−1]* 2 or A = A[i−1] + 1, for i ≥ 1.
For example, for N = 17, the shortest sequence is:
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 2
  A[2] = 4
  A[3] = 8
  A[4] = 16
  A[5] = 17

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int N); }

that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of the shortest possible sequence of integers satisfying the above conditions and ending with N.
For example, given N = 17, the function should return 6, as explained above.
Assume that:
-N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:
-expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N));
-expected worst-case space complexity is O(1)
