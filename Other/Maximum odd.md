Write a function:

def solution(A,N)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum among all odd integers.

For example, given array A as follows:

[-6, -91, 1011, -100, 84, -22, 0, 1, 473]

the function should return 1011. 

Assum that:
- N is an integer within the range [1...1,000]
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [-10,000...10,000]
- there is at least one element in array A which satisfies the condition in the task statement.
